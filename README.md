# Patient Appointment 
You should make an appointment by calling or by email. Do not try to make appointments by text, unless you are simply asking a good friend if they would like to to have lunch. If you are making a first appointment and writing to someone you do not know be sure to give your background information and the reason for requesting an appointment.
